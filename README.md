# src.python
Discord bot that fetches recent src data



To use this bot, you'll need to install the discord.py module and have a valid bot token from Discord. Make sure to replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your actual bot token.
Make sure this bot is invited and has all intents enabled (how I coded it, sorry), then use !speedrun <game> command to fetch the current world record for a specific game on speedrun.com. For example, !speedrun supermario64.
